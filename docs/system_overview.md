The HatchMate Smart Incubator is an ESP32-based automatic egg incubator designed to
maintain optimal temperature, humidity, ventilation, and egg turning throughout a
21-day chicken egg incubation cycle.

The system provides:
- Local monitoring via OLED display, LEDs, push buttons, and buzzer
- Remote monitoring and alerts via Wi-Fi dashboard or mobile application

The incubator is designed to operate autonomously and continues safe operation
even if Wi-Fi or internet connectivity is lost.

## Project Objectives
- Maintain incubation temperature at 37.5°C ±0.5°C
- Control humidity based on incubation stage
- Automatically turn eggs at fixed intervals
- Ensure adequate air circulation
- Provide visual and audible alerts
- Enable remote monitoring via Wi-Fi
